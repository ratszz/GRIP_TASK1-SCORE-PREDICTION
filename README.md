# GRIP_TASKS_1_SCORE_PREDICTION
I've made this project as a part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation under the GRIP internship. This project is based on linear regression for predicting scores of students based on the  hours they studied.
It can be opened on jupyter notebook as well as google collab. I've worked with google collab, so a different library is used to upload the csv file. if you are using jupyter notebook, give the path of the file then use read_csv(path) as usual.
(Only If you are uploading the data set from your local machine)
