# GRIP_TASK1-SCORE-PREDICTION
This project is based on linear regression for predicting scores of students based on the hours they studied. You can open this notebook on Jupyter or Google collab.
I've worked on Google Collab, so a different library is used to upload the csv file.If you are using jupyter Notebook, give the path of the file then use read_csv(path) as usual.
